# Cannon-AI-Bot

This project implements a bot to play a chess-like strategy game, "The Game of Cannons". To know more about the game and rules, see [this](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/courses/col333/autumn2019/A2/A2.pdf)

Compile and run `play.cpp` to play the game.

While running, you can choose to play against the bot, or you can watch bot play against itself.
